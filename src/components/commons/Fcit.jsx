                    "Faculty of Computing & Information Technology was established on January, 2021. Faculty comprised of Department of Computer Science, Department of Software Engineer, Department of Information Technology and Department of Data Science. Before that it was Punjab University of College of Information (PUCIT) working under Faculty of Science.The College took a modest start with the Center for Computer Science, established in the Center for Solid State Physics, Quaid-e-Azam (New) Campus, Lahore, in 1988. The first degree program offered by the Center was a one-year Post Graduate Diploma (PGD) in Computer Science. 24 students were registered in this program during the first year. The Center was upgraded to Department of Computer Science in 1991. The Department started 2-year (4-semesters) PGD leading to MSc in Computer Science under the annual system. In its first batch, the 15 students were admitted to this program. The number doubled the following year. The Vice Chancellor, Lt Gen (R) Arshad Mahmood, further upgraded the Department to a constituent College in November 2000. The college was named Punjab University College of Information Technology (PUCIT). The College launched the 4-year (8-semester) BSc (Honors) in Compute Science program in November 2000. The classes of the new BSc (Hons) in Computer Science started in January 2001 with about 180 students. The program was offered on Self-Support basis only. The curricula for all Bachelors degree programs were revised according to the recommendations and guidelines of the HEC, Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) USA, and Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) USA in July 2006. MS/MPhil Computer Science and MSc GIS (morning) programs were launched in Fall 2006 and BS Software Engineering in Fall 2007. The College took major infrastructural renovation projects starting June 2006 to renovate existing faculty offices, construct new offices for around 30 faculty, install new multimedia equipment and PCs in class rooms and teaching labs, purchase new PCs for the GIS Centre lab, install underground campus computer network, and uplift the library interior with tiled floors, wall paneling, individual study desks, and an e-mail kiosk in order to make the library environment more conducive for studies."
