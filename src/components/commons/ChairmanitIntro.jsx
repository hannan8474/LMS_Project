Presently, though the university enjoys globally a pretty decent reputation but particularly in Asia. The university has been ranked amongst the best 22-percent universities in Asia by QS World university Rankings. Further, besides of CoVID-19 pandemic still the varsity managed to climb up the ladder by improving 16-percent in international ranking. Moreover, keeping in perspective the future demands of a rapidly chp  anging world, the varsity underwent mammoth restructuring of academic units, resulting in establishment of new faculties and departments. Now, we are ready for the challenges of the future. The legacy of Punjab university, a future guiding tool for us, is such that it has produced numerous notable scholars and scientists, whose ideas and research contributions have revolutionized and transformed the society at large. Allama Muhammad Iqbal and Dr. Abdus Salam are only two from among such notable alumni. Hence, it would be apt to claim that the establishment of Punjab university on October 14, 1882 must be marked as a memorable day, as it changed the course of history, and I am confident, the varsity will continue to do so.”</i></p>
