                        <p className="py-3">FCIT Sports Society conducted a Sports League that consisted of two tournaments, Cricket and Badminton, last month that proved to be a huge success. The event was initiated with a small opening ceremony where the participants were told about the rules of the game. The games were started immediately after the opening ceremony. The cricket tournament was held at Khalid Bin Waleed Hostelâ€™s ground and was for boys only. The badminton tournament was only for girls that was conducted at the badminton court in FCIT Old Campus. Participants showed great zeal for the game and every match of cricket and badminton was worth watching. All the participants showcased their skills and fought well to take the top position. On top of that, the audience was also very zealous and motivating towards their favorite players and teams and their cheers helped the players to showcase their talent in an even better way. Both tournaments received an extensive response from the students and no decorum of the university was disturbed at all. The conduction of this Sports League proved to be a breath of fresh air for students in their hectic routines. FCIT Sports Society encourages all the students to extravagantly participate in different games and leagues to enjoy these off-work times to the fullest.</p>
